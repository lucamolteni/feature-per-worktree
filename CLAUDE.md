# Hibernate Workspace — Claude Orchestration

This is the root directory for daily work. Claude is run from here and has access to all repos and feature branches.
This root folder is a **git repository** itself, but contains no source code — only orchestration, scripts, and Claude config. All `main/` and feature directories (and their `.m2` dirs) should be in `.gitignore`.

## Repositories

All repos follow the same remote convention:

| Repo                 | upstream (read-only)                                  | origin (fork)                                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| quarkus              | `git@github.com:quarkusio/quarkus.git`                | `git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/quarkus.git`               |
| hibernate-orm        | `git@github.com:hibernate/hibernate-orm.git`          | `git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/hibernate-orm.git`         |
| hibernate-reactive   | `git@github.com:hibernate/hibernate-reactive.git`     | `git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/hibernate-reactive.git`    |
| hibernate-tools      | `git@github.com:hibernate/hibernate-tools.git`        | `git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/hibernate-tools.git`       |
| quarkus-wiki         | TBD                                                   | TBD                                                    |

## The `main/` folder

- Contains the "real" clones of all repos (not worktrees).
- Always tracks `upstream/main` — reset hourly via a bash script.
- hibernate-orm and hibernate-reactive use Gradle. Their SNAPSHOTs are built via `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x test`.
- Uses the global `~/.m2/repository` — no `-Dmaven.repo.local` override needed. `main/` is the source of truth and doesn't need isolation.
- **Refresh script** is a long-running bash script (not a cron job). When executed, it loops: fetches upstream, resets all repos to `upstream/main`, rebuilds Quarkus (`scripts/build-fast.sh`), then sleeps for 1 hour and repeats. The user decides when to start/stop it.
- Quarkus build uses `mvnd` (Maven Daemon) for faster parallel builds. `~/.m2` must always be ready for comparison.

## Feature directories (e.g. `3223/`)

- Named after the issue number (e.g., QUARKUS-3223 becomes `3223/`).
- Created on demand with a skill.
- Always contains a Quarkus worktree (all features involve Quarkus so far).
- Other repos (hibernate-orm, hibernate-reactive) are added on demand via a separate skill.
- Each feature has its own `.m2` directory, seeded from `~/.m2/repository` using `rsync --link-dest` (hardlinks).
  - This is instant and uses near-zero extra disk space.
  - Only rebuilt SNAPSHOT artifacts (io/quarkus/*, org/hibernate/*) diverge and use real space.
  - Maven config (`.mvn/maven.config`) in each worktree points to the feature's `.m2` via `-Dmaven.repo.local`.

## IntelliJ IDEA

- Each repo in a feature is opened as a **separate IntelliJ project** (no multi-module).
- Both `main/` and feature dirs must be openable in IDEA and able to run tests directly.
- The per-feature `.m2` + `.mvn/maven.config` ensures IDEA uses the correct local repo.

## A/B Comparison Workflow

When in doubt about how something worked before a change:
1. Open `main/quarkus` in IDEA (or run Maven there) — it has pre-built upstream SNAPSHOTs ready.
2. Open `3223/quarkus` in IDEA — it has the feature branch with its own SNAPSHOTs.
3. Both are independently buildable and testable without interfering with each other.

## Maven Isolation: Feature builds must not pollute ~/.m2

Feature worktrees must be configured so Maven **never** reads from or writes to the global `~/.m2`. This is enforced via `-Dmaven.repo.local=<feature>/.m2` in each worktree's `.mvn/maven.config`. The feature `.m2` is seeded from `~/.m2/repository` via hardlinks so all artifacts are available locally.

`main/` repos use `~/.m2` directly (no override) since they are the source of truth.

## Skills Needed

1. **init-workspace** — Clone all repos into `main/`, set up remotes (origin + upstream), do initial Quarkus build into `~/.m2`.
2. **create-feature** — e.g., "create feature 3223" → creates `3223/` dir, Quarkus worktree on branch `QUARKUS-3223`, seeds `.m2` from `~/.m2/repository` via hardlinks, sets up `.mvn/maven.config`.
3. **add-repo-to-feature** — e.g., "add hibernate-orm to 3223" → creates worktree in `3223/hibernate-orm/` from `main/hibernate-orm`.
4. **refresh-main** — Bash script for hourly loop: fetches upstream, resets all repos to upstream/main, rebuilds Quarkus into `~/.m2`.
5. **delete-feature** — Cleans up worktrees (via `git worktree remove`) and deletes the feature directory + its `.m2`. Archives the journal to `journal/<feature>/` before deletion.
6. **write-journal** — e.g., "/write-journal" → appends a daily journal entry for the current feature, capturing session context and git commits.

## Shell Aliases

Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
alias build-fast="~/git/hibernate/scripts/build-fast.sh"
alias build-docs="~/git/hibernate/scripts/build-docs.sh"
alias format="~/git/hibernate/scripts/format.sh"
alias local_repo='echo ">>> maven.repo.local: $(mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=settings.localRepository -q -DforceStdout 2>/dev/null)"'
alias qss="java -jar ${HOME}/git/quarkus/devtools/cli/target/quarkus-cli-999-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar"
```

- `build-fast` — full Quarkus build skipping tests, docs, and non-essential steps
- `build-docs` — build with docs but skip tests
- `format` — run source formatting only
- `local_repo` — print the effective Maven local repository path (uses `mvn`, not `mvnd` — mvnd doesn't support `-q -DforceStdout` for `help:evaluate`)
- `qss` — run Quarkus CLI from local SNAPSHOT build

## Git Structure of This Repo

This root directory (`~/git/hibernate/`) is its own git repo containing:
- `CLAUDE.md` — this file
- Scripts (refresh loop, maven safety check, etc.)
- `.gitignore` — excludes `main/`, feature dirs (`[0-9]*/`), and `.m2/` directories
- No source code
