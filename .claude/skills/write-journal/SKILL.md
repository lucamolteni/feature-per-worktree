# Write Journal

Usage: `/write-journal [extra context]` (e.g., `/write-journal we decided to drop the reactive approach`)

Appends a journal entry for the current feature, capturing what was done in the session.

## Feature Detection

Auto-detect which feature is active:

1. Check the current working directory for a feature path (e.g., `~/git/hibernate/3223/...`)
2. Check conversation context for recent commands or file reads in a feature directory
3. If ambiguous or no feature context is found, ask the user which feature to journal

## Writing the Entry

1. **Determine the current date and time**:
   ```bash
   date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
   ```

2. **Gather git commits** on the feature branch(es) since the last journal entry (or all commits if no prior entry exists). Parse the first `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` heading from the existing day file to determine the cutoff:
   ```bash
   # For each repo in the feature directory:
   cd ~/git/hibernate/<feature>/<repo>
   git log --oneline --since="<last entry timestamp or start of day>" HEAD
   ```

3. **Build the entry** from:
   - Session context: what problems were investigated, what was tried, what was learned
   - Git commits as milestones (short hash, commit message)
   - User-provided extra text (from the argument)

4. **Write to file** at `~/git/hibernate/<feature>/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
   - If the file exists, prepend the new entry at the top (newest first), separated by a blank line from the existing content
   - If the file does not exist, create it

## Entry Format

Each entry starts with a heading using the datetime, followed by bullet points. Entries must have enough prose to understand the problem context a month later.

- Found the root cause of the flaky ORM batch insert test. H2 uses READ_COMMITTED by default but the test assumed REPEATABLE_READ. Fixed by explicitly setting the isolation level in the test configuration.
- commit: def5678 - Fix flaky batch insert test isolation level
```

## Formatting Rules

- No bold, no italics, no code blocks, no emoji
- Only headings (##) and unordered bullet lists (-)
- Terse but substantive: enough context to understand the problem, not just a list of actions
- No AI slop: no filler phrases, no unnecessary padding

## After Writing

Print the entry that was written and the file path.
