# Today Journal

Usage: `/today-journal`

Produces a two-line summary of today's work across all features.

## Steps

1. Determine today's date:
   ```bash
   date "+%Y-%m-%d"
   ```

2. Scan all feature directories under `~/git/hibernate/` for today's journal. Check every directory that has a `journal/` subfolder:
   ```bash
   find ~/git/hibernate -maxdepth 2 -type d -name journal
   ```
   Then check each for a `YYYY-MM-DD.md` file matching today's date.

3. Read all matching journal files. If none exist, say so and stop.

4. Produce two or three bullet points summarizing the entire day's work across all features. The summary should:
   - Cover all entries from all features, not just the latest one
   - Be concrete: mention what was built, fixed, refactored, or discovered
   - If multiple features had work, cover both

5. Copy the two-line summary to the clipboard:
   ```bash
   echo "<summary>" | pbcopy
   ```

6. Print the summary and confirm it was copied to the clipboard.
